]

---

### Motivating example: Dengue data

.large[
**Data:** Data on 5720 Vietnamese children, admitted to the hospital with possible dengue fever. Variables include:

* *Sex*: patient's sex (female or male)
* *Age*: patient's age (in years)
* *WBC*: white blood cell count
* *PLT*: platelet count
* other diagnostic variables...
* *Dengue*: whether the patient has dengue (0 = no, 1 = yes)
]

---

### Research questions

.large[
* How well can we predict whether a patient has dengue?
* Which diagnostic measurements are most useful?
* Is there a significant relationship between age and dengue?
]

.large[
.question[
How can I answer each of these questions? Discuss with a neighbor for 2 minutes, then we will discuss as a class.
]
]

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

.large[
.question[
What plot can we use to visualize the response (dengue status)?
]

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

.large[
.question[
What plot can we use to visualize the response (dengue status)?
]

**Answer:** Bar chart
]

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
library(tidyverse)
dengue <- read.csv("https://sta279-s22.github.io/labs/dengue.csv")

dengue %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(Dengue))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Dengue status") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=20))
```

]

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.height=4}

### Class activity

.large[
[https://sta214-s23.github.io/class_activities/ca_lecture_1.html](https://sta214-s23.github.io/class_activities/ca_lecture_1.html)

In the class activity, you'll start to explore the relationship between age and dengue.

Spend a few minutes to do the following:

* Say hi to the people around you, introduce yourself
* Work in groups on the class activity
* You don't need to submit your work
]

---

### Class activity

.large[
.question[
What is the (empirical) probability that a patient in the study has dengue?
]
]

.large[
$P(\text{Dengue} = 1) =$
]

---

### Class activity

.large[
.question[
What is the (empirical) probability that a 5 year old patient has dengue? What about a 10 year old patient?
]
]

.large[
$P(\text{Dengue} = 1 | \text{Age} = 5) =$

$P(\text{Dengue} = 1 | \text{Age} = 10) =$
]


---


## Odds

.large[
.question[
What are the (empirical) odds that a 5 year old patient has dengue?
]
]


---

### Fitting a model: initial attempt

.large[
What if we try a linear regression model?

$$Y_i = \text{dengue status of } i\text{th  patient}$$

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Age_i + \varepsilon_i \hspace{1cm} \varepsilon_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\varepsilon^2)$$
]

.large[
.question[
What are some potential issues with this linear regression model? Discuss with your neighbors for 1--2 minutes, then we will discuss as a class.
]
]

---

### Don't fit linear regression with a binary response

```{r setup, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', message=F, warning=F}
library(patchwork)

p1 <- dengue %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Dengue)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F, lwd=1.5) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))

p2 <- dengue %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = WBC, y = Dengue)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F, lwd=1.5) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))

p1 + p2
```

### Revisiting the linear regression model

---

### Parametric modeling

.large[

A regression model is an example of a more general process called **parametric modeling**

* **Step 1:** Choose a reasonable distribution for $Y_i$
* **Step 2:** Build a model for the parameters of interest
* **Step 3:** Fit the model

]

---

### Step 1: Choose a reasonable distribution for $Y_i$

.large[
.question[
What do I mean by a *distribution*?
]
]

---

### Step 1: Choose a reasonable distribution for $Y_i$

.large[
.question[
What do I mean by a *distribution*?
]
]

.large[
* A **distribution** tells us what outcomes are possible for $Y_i$, and how often these outcomes occur.

Here the possible values of $Y_i$ are 0 (no dengue) and 1 (dengue).

.question[
How often do these values occur in the population?
]

]

.large[
* A **distribution** tells us what outcomes are possible for $Y_i$, and how often these outcomes occur.

.question[

]

]

.large[
* We don't know, so we will estimate from the sample
* We assume the probability $Y_i = 1$ depends on $Age_i$
]

### Step 1: Choose a reasonable distribution for $Y_i$

.large[
.question[
How should I describe the distribution of $Y_i$?
]
]

---

### Bernoulli distribution

.large[
**Definition:** Let $Y_i$ be a binary random variable, and $\pi_i = P(Y_i = 1)$. Then $Y_i \sim Bernoulli(\pi_i)$.

.question[
What do I mean by a *random variable*?
]
]

---

### Bernoulli distribution

.large[
**Definition:** Let $Y_i$ be a binary random variable, and $\pi_i = P(Y_i = 1)$. Then $Y_i \sim Bernoulli(\pi_i)$.

.question[
What do I mean by a *random variable*?
]
]

.large[
A **random variable** is an event that has a set of possible outcomes, but we don't know which one will occur

* Here $Y_i = 0$ or $1$
* Our goal is to use the observed data to estimate $\pi_i = P(Y_i = 1)$
]

---

### Second attempt at a model

.large[
$$Y_i \sim Bernoulli(\pi_i) \hspace{1cm} \pi_i = P(Y_i = 1 | Age_i)$$

$$\pi_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Age_i$$
]

.large[
.question[
Are there still any potential issues with this approach?
]
]

---

### Fixing the issues

---

### Logistic regression model

.large[

$Y_i =$ dengue status (0 = negative, 1 = positive) 

$Age_i =$ age (in years)

**Random component:** $\hspace{1cm} Y_i \sim Bernoulli(\pi_i)$

**Systematic component:** $\hspace{1cm} \log \left( \dfrac{\pi_i}{1 - \pi_i} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ Age_i$

### Extensions and late work

.large[
**Extensions:** You have a bank of **5** extension days, which you may use over the course of the semester. You may use either one or two days for a given assignment. *Additional extensions may be given, on an individual basis, in extenuating circumstances.*

**Late work:** An assignment will be marked off 20% for every 24 hours it is late (past the original due date).

If you know you cannot turn in an assignment (for instance, if you are ill or there is a family emergency), let me know before the assignment is due, and we will work something out. There will be no grade changes
after our last day of class.
