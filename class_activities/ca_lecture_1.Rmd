In this activity, you will start to investigate the relationship between age and dengue status, from the dataset of 5720 Vietnamese children admitted to hospital with potential dengue fever.

# Questions

One way to examine the relationship between age and dengue status is with a table:

| Age|  Dengue = 0| Dengue =  1|
|---:|---:|---:|
|   1| 184|  16|
|   2| 419|  42|
|   3| 532|  68|
|   4| 457| 108|
|   5| 487| 122|
|   6| 369| 110|
|   7| 360| 148|
|   8| 289| 161|
|   9| 244| 186|
|  10| 185| 185|
|  11| 165| 148|
|  12| 126| 137|
|  13|  96| 107|
|  14|  68|  97|
|  15|  42|  62|
| **Total**  | 4023 | 1697 |

I say *empirical* probability here because we are estimating it from the observed data.
```

1. What is the (empirical) probability that a patient in the study has dengue?

2. What is the (empirical) probability that a 5 year old patient has dengue? What about a 10 year old patient?

3. If $\pi$ is the probability of some event, then the *odds* are $\dfrac{\pi}{1 - \pi}$. Calculate the (empirical) odds that a 5 year old patient has dengue.
